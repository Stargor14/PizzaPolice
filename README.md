# PizzaPolice
Discord Bot that automatically detects photos of pizza and deletes them

Uses opencv image recognition to analyze photos for pizzas and automatically delete them. Why? because inside jokes thats why. 

Could easily be used to analyze different subjects, but pizza is obviously the most useful and practical use for the complex compter vision algorithm.
